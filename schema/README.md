# Toolkit Schemas

This directory contains schemas used by the UI.

- Active:
  - `config_env.schema.json` â€“ minimal schema used to validate emitted `config.[env].yaml`
  - Phase 2/3 modeling now uses Zod schemas from `@docs-as-code/shared-types`; JSON Schemas for those have been removed to avoid duplication.

## Purpose: YAML vs JSON files

- YAML templates for legacy requirements have been removed per migration.

- JSON (`*.schema.json`)
  - For the new wizard, only `config_env.schema.json` remains to validate emitted `config.[env].yaml` structure.
  - Modeling (Phase 2/3) validation is done via Zod in code; see `@docs-as-code/shared-types`.

## How they work together

1. The UI drives runtime validation of emitted `config.[env].yaml` against `config_env.schema.json`.
2. Modeling validation uses Zod schemas during form handling and on save.

Notes
- The legacy requirements templates and schemas are deprecated.
- The active validation target is the Toolkit config files generated by the new wizard.
