Of course. Based on your specific context of managing a **Flexible Data Model** (Graph Model) using the **CDF Toolkit** and/or **Python SDK**, here is a refined, clean breakdown of the requirements gathering framework.

This framework is tailored to your infrastructure-as-code approach, focusing on defining the necessary configurations for `Spaces`, `Containers`, `Views`, `Nodes`, and `Edges`.

### Hierarchical Requirements Blueprint (Flexible Data Model)

This table provides a high-level overview of the requirements gathering process, broken down into distinct phases and objectives.

| Phase | Objective | Key Artifacts / Outputs |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Foundation & Management Setup** | Establish project goals and configure the local and cloud environments for managing CDF as code. | Business Use Case Document, Git Repository, Service Principal Credentials, CDF Group Structure, Naming Conventions. |
| **2. Flexible Data Model Design** | Translate business domain knowledge into a concrete, graph-based data model structure within CDF. | Whiteboard Diagrams of Nodes & Edges, Container Definitions (YAML/JSON), View Definitions (YAML/JSON), Space Definition. |
| **3. Data Consumption & Access Patterns**| Define how the data model will be queried and used, ensuring it meets the needs of end-users and applications. | Sample Queries (GraphQL), SDK Usage Patterns, Application Interface Requirements. |
| **4. Governance & Operations (CI/CD)** | Define the process for deploying, versioning, and managing the data model configuration over its lifecycle. | CI/CD Pipeline Definition, Change Management Process Document, Data Model Versioning Strategy. |

### Step-by-Step Walkthrough for Requirements Gathering

Here is a detailed walkthrough of the data and decisions required at each step, focusing on generating the configurations for your Toolkit or SDK scripts.

---

### **Phase 1: Foundation & Management Setup**

**Goal:** To set up the entire ecosystem required to manage your CDF project as code.

* #### **Step 1.1: Define Business Objectives & Key Queries**
    * **What to Gather:** Before writing any code, understand *why* you're building this model. Facilitate a workshop with domain experts to define the critical business questions the graph model must answer.
    * **Example Questions to Ask:**
        * "What is the primary goal? Is it to trace equipment maintenance history, find root causes of failures, or optimize a production line?"
        * "Give me 5 to 10 specific questions you would ask if this data were perfectly connected. For example, 'Show me all pumps from manufacturer X that have had a work order of type Y in the last 6 months and are connected to a specific pipeline.'"
        * "Who are the end-users? Data scientists, reliability engineers, or an application?"

* #### **Step 1.2: Configure the Management Environment (Toolkit/SDK)**
    * **What to Gather:** This step is about the technical setup for your development team.
    * **Example Questions to Ask:**
        * **Version Control:** "Which Git provider will we use (GitHub, Azure Repos)? What will our repository be named?"
        * **Authentication:** "How will our tools authenticate to the CDF project? We will need to create a **service principal** (or client) in your IdP (like Azure AD) and grant it the necessary permissions in CDF. What are the client ID and secret?"
        * **Local Setup:** "How will developers configure the CDF Toolkit or Python SDK on their machines? Where will we securely store credentials?"

* #### **Step 1.3: Define CDF Project Security & Naming Conventions**
    * **What to Gather:** Establish the ground rules for your CDF project to ensure consistency and security.
    * **Example Questions to Ask:**
        * **CDF Groups:** "What roles are needed? Let's define CDF groups (e.g., `datamodel-admins`, `datamodel-readers`). Which IdP groups will map to these CDF groups?"
        * **Capabilities:** "What permissions should each group have? For example, the `admins` group needs `spaces:read/write` and `views:read/write`, while `readers` only need `nodes:read` and `edges:read`."
        * **Naming Conventions:** "What is our naming convention for Spaces, Containers, and Views? For example, `[usecase]_[objectType]` (e.g., `maintenance_Pump`, `drilling_Wellbore`)."

---

### **Phase 2: Flexible Data Model Design**

**Goal:** To create the formal definition of your graph model as code. This is the core of the requirements process.

* #### **Step 2.1: Discover the Nodes (The "Things")**
    * **What to Gather:** In a workshop, identify all the core objects or entities in your domain. Think of these as the "nouns."
    * **Example Questions to Ask:**
        * "Let's list all the physical and conceptual objects we care about. Pumps, motors, work orders, maintenance reports, wells, sensors, schematics, etc."
        * "Which of these are unique, identifiable things? Each one will become a **Node** in our graph."

* #### **Step 2.2: Define the Containers (The "Properties of Things")**
    * **What to Gather:** For each type of Node, define its properties. This translates directly into a **Container** definition in the CDF Toolkit.
    * **Example Questions to Ask:**
        * "For a 'Pump,' what information do we need to store? Manufacturer, model number, installation date, capacity?"
        * "For each property, what is its data type (`string`, `float`, `boolean`, `timestamp`)? Is it a required field?"
        * "Should this property be indexed for faster searching?"
        * This discussion will directly result in a YAML file for each Container (e.g., `pump.container.yaml`).

* #### **Step 2.3: Define the Edges (The "Relationships")**
    * **What to Gather:** Map out how the Nodes are connected to each other. These are the "verbs" that link your nouns.
    * **Example Questions to Ask:**
        * "How does a 'Work Order' relate to a 'Pump'? Is it 'performed on' the pump?"
        * "How does a 'Sensor' relate to a 'Pump'? Does it 'measure' the pump?"
        * "What do we call this relationship? Let's define the edge types (e.g., `isLocatedAt`, `feedsInto`, `hasChild`)."

* #### **Step 2.4: Design the Views (The "Lens" for your Data)**
    * **What to Gather:** A **View** combines properties from one or more Containers to create a complete, queryable version of a Node. This is how you will access your data.
    * **Example Questions to Ask:**
        * "When we query for a 'Pump,' what is the complete set of properties we want to see? Should it include properties from a generic 'Asset' container and a more specific 'RotatingEquipment' container?"
        * "How will we version this View? We must define a version number (e.g., `v1`)."
        * "What will we name the final View (e.g., `PumpView`)?"
        * This results in a set of View definition YAML files (e.g., `pump.view.yaml`).

### Resuming work and importing YAML

- **Resume after clearing browser data**: Re-select the repository. The app loads the last saved UI-state JSON for each tier. No implicit YAML import occurs.
- **If only YAML exists**: A banner offers two choices:
  - Import from YAML: Parses/validates YAML and seeds the UI-state JSON so you can continue editing.
  - Start fresh: Begin with empty defaults (e.g., dev/prod env rows) without importing.
- **Single source of truth while editing**: UI-state JSON is the working state. YAML is generated on Finish (or explicit Export). UI-only fields do not appear in YAML.

### **Phase 3: Data Consumption & Access Patterns**

**Goal:** Validate that the model you designed in Phase 2 can answer the business questions from Phase 1.

* #### **Step 3.1: Formulate Sample Queries**
    * **What to Gather:** Translate the business questions from Step 1.1 into technical queries (e.g., GraphQL).
    * **Example Activity:**
        * "Let's take the question: 'Show me all pumps that had a failure event.' We will write a pseudo-query: `query { nodes(type: "PumpView") { filter(has: "failure_event") { ... } } }`. Does our model support this query easily?"
        * This step validates your Container and View design. If the queries are too complex, you may need to redesign your Views.

---

### **Phase 4: Governance & Operations (CI/CD)**

**Goal:** Finalize the workflow for deploying and maintaining your data model.

* #### **Step 4.1: Define the Deployment & Promotion Strategy**
    * **What to Gather:** The process for moving your data model from development to production.
    * **Example Questions to Ask:**
        * "How will we deploy changes? Will a developer run the CDF Toolkit `deploy` command, or will it be automated in a **CI/CD pipeline** (e.g., GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps)?"
        * "What is our environment strategy? Do we have separate `dev`, `test`, and `prod` CDF projects? How do we promote configurations between them?"

* #### **Step 4.2: Establish a Change Management Process**
    * **What to Gather:** The "human" process for evolving the data model.
    * **Example Questions to Ask:**
        * "If a user needs a new property added to the 'Pump' Container, what is the process? Who needs to approve the change?"
        * "How do we handle versioning? When we make a breaking change to a View, do we create a new version (e.g., `PumpView v2`) or update the existing one?"
