#### **1. User-Centric & Business Value Questions**

This line of questioning focuses on ensuring the project is solving a real, quantifiable problem for the right people.

- **The User Persona:** "The document mentions the 'Solution Architect' as the user. Can we create a more detailed persona? What is their typical day like? What are their primary frustrations with the current YAML-based process? Are there secondary users, like junior engineers or data analysts, we should also consider?"
	- Answers
		- We will have multiple personas, but I think we should cater to more non technical business SMEs who are domain experts. This may be a Cognite Data Fusion Customer who is helping describe their systems we are trying to model
		- Personas
			- Solution Architects
				- Audit the system
				- Apply updates
				- Create new Data Modules
				- Deploy CDF projects across dev and prod
			- Data Engineers
				- Create Spark SQL Transformations
				- Use Extractors and write custom extractors
			- Business SMEs
				- Visualize the Data Model
				- Add in data types
				- Naming Schemas
				- Data validation constraints
			- Stakeholders 
				- Visualize Data Model
				- Review all changes 
- **Measuring Success (KPIs):** "How will we know if this UI is successful? What are the key performance indicators (KPIs) we will track? Are we aiming to reduce deployment errors by X%, decrease the time to configure a new module by Y hours, or increase the number of deployments per week?"
	- Dont care at this point. The point of this application is a structured format of information. The main thing is does this help the user fill out and review the information.
    
- **Return on Investment (ROI):** "Beyond the KPIs, what is the tangible business value? How does reducing configuration time translate into faster project delivery or cost savings? Can we quantify the impact of fewer configuration errors on system reliability and operational efficiency?"
	- Dont care ignore this at the moment
    
- **The "Human-in-the-Loop" Experience:** "Section 6.1 mentions a 'Human Architect' who 'Reviews & Approves'. What does this UX actually look like? How are changes presented for review? Is there a 'diff' view? What is the process if they reject a change made by the AI?"
	- This is a great question. I think there needs to be a visual of all the relationships for one. Meaning an overview that they can see all of the relationships and attributes of the graph model. For the MVP if we can just show all of this detail in the UI and be able to zoom the screen and clearly see all the attributes of entities it would be great. I think the second part would be a check list or the ability to go entity by entity to check off that you approve of the entity and the relationships.
    

#### **2. MVP & Scoping Questions**

These questions test the logic behind the MVP scope and ensure it's a valid first step.

- **MVP Rationale:** "Why was the `00_Solution_Design_Principles.md` template chosen for the MVP over the others? Is it the most frequently used, the simplest to implement, or the one that provides the most immediate value?"
```markdown
### How the three templates fit together (tiered, cascading design)

- Tier 1 — Project level (00_Solution_Design_Principles.md)

- Sets the guardrails and shared context for the whole project.

- Defines environments (dev/prod), spaces, naming, security roles, and

promotion rules.

- Establishes ID macros (e.g., {{ moduleId }}) and global standards (e.g.,

inheritance defaults like CogniteAsset).

- Downstream impact: values and conventions here are referenced by tiers 2 and

3 to ensure consistency and portability across modules.

- Tier 2 — Module level (01_CONCEPTUAL_MODEL_TEMPLATE.md)

- Maps the business domain into core objects, their relationships, and the

module’s data model.

- For each object, specifies type (Asset, Event, etc.), view/container IDs,

and space.

- Defines the graph of relationships (direct or edge), labels, multiplicity,

and basic resolution hints.

- Downstream impact: becomes the blueprint for detailed object specs, and

groups views into a deployable data model for the module.

- Tier 3 — Object level (XX_Object_Specification_Template.md)

- Provides the full, implementation‑ready spec for each object named in tier

1. - Details properties (types, nullability, source fields), indexes,

uniqueness, and view config (implements/requires).

- Enriches relationships with source fields, resolution rules, and labels.

- Includes transformation plans, data quality rules, and observability hooks.

- Downstream impact: generates the precise resources needed to populate and

query the model.

### How changes flow (docs‑as‑code with AI‑assisted cascade)

- Design in Markdown: Teams capture intent at the right tier:

- Tier 1 for project‑wide standards and spaces,

- Tier 2 for module objects and relationships,

- Tier 3 for per‑object implementation details.

- AI‑driven cascade: Playbooks read the templates and propagate updates

downstream, keeping tiers aligned (e.g., a new standard or space in tier 1

updates tier 2/3 refs; a new object in tier 2 triggers a new tier 3 spec).

- Human‑in‑the‑loop: Changes are proposed as diffs for review before

acceptance.

- Generation to deployment: Approved specs are converted into Cognite

Toolkit YAML:

- Tier 1 → config.[env].yaml, accessgroups/*.group.yaml

- Tier 2 → datamodels/*.model.yaml

- Tier 3 → datamodels/containers/*.container.yaml,

datamodels/views/*.view.yaml, and related transformations

- Tooling then validates and deploys to CDF.

### Why this matters for a PM

- Consistency at scale: One source of truth ensures modules and teams stay

aligned with standards and security.

- Speed to value: Structured templates plus AI reduce cycle time from

requirements to deployable config.

- Traceability: Every decision is versioned; reviews happen on diffs; changes

are auditable.

- Modularity: Projects scale by adding modules (tier 2) and object specs

(tier 3) without breaking global rules (tier 1).

### One‑line example

Add a “Work Order” object in tier 2, generate its tier 3 spec (properties,

relationships to “Well”), and the system produces the YAML to deploy the view,

container, and transformations under the standards set in tier 1.

- The three templates form a tiered system: project → module → object.

- Changes cascade via AI from high level to implementable YAML with review.

- Benefits: faster delivery, consistent standards, and clear auditability
```
    
- **Validation Depth:** "The plan mentions real-time validation against the Zod schema. What happens when a user enters data that is syntactically valid but logically incorrect for a CDF deployment? How much business logic validation will the UI handle versus the downstream AI service?"
	- User input is always tricky. This is an MVP so we will have a very small user group. This application will be used and tested by less than 10 people at a time and all on their own individual basis. We should try to do out best to validate user inputs, but ultimately we need to let the users make mistakes so we can learn about how they are using the product.
    
- **Defining "Done":** "The MVP checklist is excellent for features. What are the quality and performance acceptance criteria? For example, what is the maximum acceptable load time for a form? How many concurrent users should the MVP be able to support?"
	- This MVP will be a locally hosted application on the users computer. There will only be one user at a time so really not concerned about the speed at this time. We need to focus on the local application aspect at this time though. This is a crucial architecture point we need to focus on.
    

#### **3. Roadmap & Future Strategy Questions**

A PM/PO is always thinking about what comes after the initial launch.

- **Phase Gates:** "What are the specific criteria that will allow us to move from Phase 1 (MVP) to Phase 2 (Expansion), and from Phase 2 to Phase 3 (Integration)? Will this be based on user adoption metrics, feedback surveys, or successful deployments?"
    
- **Feedback Loop:** "Once the MVP is in users' hands, what is the formal process for collecting, prioritizing, and incorporating their feedback into the backlog for future phases?"
    
- **Prioritizing Advanced Features:** "Phase 3 mentions advanced features like conditional fields and `useFieldArray`. How will we prioritize which of these to build first? Will it be based on which module needs them most urgently or which feature unblocks the most users?"  
    

#### **4. Risks, Dependencies, & Operational Questions**

This area focuses on external factors and long-term sustainability.

- **The AI Service Dependency:** "The 'AI Generation Service' in the workflow diagram is a critical dependency. Is this an existing service or a new one to be built? Who owns it? What are its performance and reliability SLAs? What is our contingency plan if the AI service is down or produces incorrect YAML?"
    
- **Security and Governance:** "The application will generate configurations that have significant power over our CDF projects. What is the plan for security reviews? How will we manage permissions within the UI itself, especially as we move into Phase 4 with authentication?"
    
- **Onboarding and Training:** "What is the go-to-market strategy for this internal tool? How will we onboard and train architects to move from their current workflow to this new UI-driven one? Will there be documentation and support channels?"

### **Identified Gaps and Unclear Areas**

The questions above highlight several areas where the document could be strengthened from a product perspective:

1. **Quantifiable Problem Statement:** The document excellently describes the solution but could be more explicit about the pain points it's solving. Adding metrics or anecdotes about the current process (e.g., "engineers spend up to 4 hours debugging YAML syntax errors," or "project setup is delayed by an average of 3 days due to configuration issues") would create a stronger business case.
	1. We are looking to speed up getting Cognite Data Fusion projects for new customers faster. We need to very quickly set up projects and go from 0 to 1. 
	2. Implementing new data models can be tricky and take a long time trying to understand the relationships between custom data types and also cognite's core data model.
	3. We are completely moving away from the relational asset heirarchy and moving to the graph model. This model is more complex so we want to make it as easy to use as possible.
	4. Knowledge transfer of human readable and digestible text is a lot faster than reading a code base.
    
2. **Success Metrics (KPIs):** There is no section defining how the success of this project will be measured. A dedicated table of KPIs (e.g., Time to Configure, Error Rate, User Satisfaction Score) would be a critical addition for a PM/PO.
	1. Dont care right now this is just a PoC. Our test base will tell us if its worth building farther.
    
3. **External Dependencies:** The "AI Generation Service" is treated as a given. The document needs to clarify the nature of this service, its ownership, and its expected performance, as it represents a significant risk and dependency for the entire workflow.
	1. The AI Generation service will be used in a Cursor or VS Code IDE with an AI assisted workflow and all of the major LLMs provided by OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. It's performance is expected to be best in class.
    
4. **Detailed User Workflow:** While the high-level workflow is diagrammed, the detailed user journey is unclear. For example, the process of loading an existing Markdown file, having the UI parse it, making edits, and then seeing the result of the AI-driven cascade is not described from a user's point of view.
	1. Humans take their understanding of the project and aggregate all of their knowledge together. That aggregated knowledge is in an unstructured format(s). This UI product is basically a form tool that will help them structure it templates we have curated well enough that an AI Assistant can build out their CDF project based on the requirements put in by the humans and the current API spec of Cognite Data Fusion.
	2. In short, this takes a ton of requirements in an unstructured for and spits them out in a structured manner.
    
5. **Error Handling and Edge Cases:** The plan covers schema validation well but doesn't detail the strategy for handling more complex errors, such as:
    
    - Errors from the AI service (e.g., it couldn't translate the input).
	    - The AI service is outside of scope for this product. This product is only generating templates. If the AI service is having trouble, there could be an error anywhere in the workflow. The User could have input bad information, the UI tool we are building could have missed validations, the template we are generating may not be suitable for the current API spec, or finally the prompt used with the AI was not adequate to translate the structured knowledge into the necessary parts for the Cognite Toolkit to use.
        
    - Errors from the CI/CD pipeline after a successful generation.  
	    - We should not be concerned with CI/CD. This is done outside of the scope of this application. The scope of this application is purely the translation of unstructured knowledge as the input to a structured output of knowledge to a template we are defining.
        
    - Logical conflicts that the schema can't catch.
